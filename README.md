# Perceptron-algorithm
Perceptron algorithm with noise experiment on neural network where  w new := w old + tx when the algorithm makes a mistake. Also compare last hypothesis/ average hypothesis/ voted hypothesis votes /  last epoch average / last epoch vote of weight vectors to verify predict accuracy.
